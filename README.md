# Capital Cities

Back in 2015 I was a student in the Type and Media program. There, I was faced with the fact that I spent a rather limited amount of time outside, or basically anywhere else apart from the studio or Spui.

Struggling with urgent wanderlust and the task to judge the relation of uppercase and lowercase letters, I created this little script. It generates a random list of city names from A to Z based on data from http://www.geonames.org/. There is also a version for Glyphs where the text gets copied to a new tab.

Sidenote: The way this is set up now, you can also feed the script other text files. So if you donâ€™t like cities, maybe you want to build your own list with the names of famous people, food or your favorite pet names.
